I want you to generate a full SaaS web app using Node.js with Express and EJS (or React if needed), plus SQLite or PostgreSQL.

Business name: Content Gist.

The web app should do the following:

1️⃣ **Authentication & Membership**
- Allow new users to sign up with email and password.
- Support login/logout sessions.
- Integrate Stripe for paid plans: Basic, Pro, Premium. Each plan has different prices and limits on how many posts I can schedule for them per month.

2️⃣ **Dashboard for each user**
- After login, users see a clean, modern dashboard with a welcome message.
- The dashboard shows a list of posts scheduled for them (created by the admin/me).
- Users can see status: Scheduled, Posted, or Draft.

3️⃣ **Admin functionality for me**
- I can log in as admin and create new posts for each user.
- I can schedule posts with content and future date/time.
- Admin dashboard shows all users and their plan, payment status, and post limits.

4️⃣ **Scheduling system**
- Use a scheduler (like node-cron) to check posts that need to be posted at scheduled time.
- When time arrives, mark post as Posted (for now just simulate; later we can connect to social media APIs).

5️⃣ **Stripe integration**
- Stripe payment checkout when user signs up or upgrades.
- Store user’s payment status and plan in DB.

6️⃣ **Database schema**
- Tables: users, posts, plans, payments.
- Each post belongs to a user, has content, scheduled time, status.

7️⃣ **UI/UX design**
- Clean, business-friendly, modern design.
- Light theme with blue and teal accents.
- Rounded buttons, good typography (Inter or Roboto).
- Responsive for desktop and mobile.

8️⃣ **Extra details**
- Send email notifications when a post is scheduled or posted (optional, if too much skip for now).
- Provide an easy "add new post" form in admin dashboard to assign posts to users.

Name the project "content-gist". Add a README file explaining how to run it. Make it fully working, so I can copy to Replit and run immediately.

Please generate complete code files including package.json, index.js (or app.js), EJS or React frontend views, public CSS, and database setup scripts if needed.
